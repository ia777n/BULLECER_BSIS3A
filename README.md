# Ian's Portfolio

## Description 
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and a bit about myself. It includes three sections: Projects, Skills, and Contact. The website is built using simple HTML, displaying different projects I've worked on and providing an easy way to reach out.

## How to Run the Project Locally 
To run the website locally using VSCode Live Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    -To clone a repository, run the Git: Clone command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), or select the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view.
    -If you clone from GitHub, VS Code prompts you to authenticate with GitHub. Then, select a repository from the list to clone to your machine.
    -For other Git providers, enter the repository URL, select Clone, and pick a folder on your local machine to clone the files into. VS Code opens the folder once the repository is cloned on your local machine.
2. **Open in VSCode:**
    -Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
    -Go to File -> Open Folder, and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
3. **Install Live Server Extension:**
    -In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab (on the left sidebar).
    -Search for Live Server and install it.
4. **Run the Site:**
    -Once the Live Server extension is installed, open the index.html file.
    -Right-click on the file and select Open with Live Server.
    -The website should open automatically in your default browser at http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

**This portfolio uses these basic HTML tags for structuring the website:**

h1, h2, h3: Used for headings and subheadings.<br>
p: For paragraphs of text.<br>
table: To display tabular data, such as projects and skills.<br>
tr, td: Table rows and data cells within the table.<br>
img: For displaying images.<br>
a: For hyperlinks, used to link to GitHub projects and social media.<br>
form, input, textarea: For the contact form section where users can send messages.<br>
section: Divides the website into different sections like Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact.<br>
footer: Contains the footer information at the bottom of the website, including copyright and social links.<br>
a: The anchor tag is used to create hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the destination URL, and the text inside the tag serves as the clickable link.<br>
&nbsp, strong, br, and align to format the website such as adding spaces, margins, breaks, and positioning the text<br>
bgcolor: Used in the body tag to set a background color for the page.<br>
width, height: Used in tags like img and td to define the size of images and table cells.<br>
