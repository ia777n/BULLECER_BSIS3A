# Ian's Portfolio

## Description 
This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my projects, skills, and a bit about myself. It includes three sections: Projects, Skills, and Contact. The website is built using simple HTML, displaying different projects I've worked on and providing an easy way to reach out.

## How to Run the Project Locally 
To run the website locally using VSCode Live Server, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    -To clone a repository, run the Git: Clone command in the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), or select the Clone Repository button in the Source Control view.
    -If you clone from GitHub, VS Code prompts you to authenticate with GitHub. Then, select a repository from the list to clone to your machine.
    -For other Git providers, enter the repository URL, select Clone, and pick a folder on your local machine to clone the files into. VS Code opens the folder once the repository is cloned on your local machine.
2. **Open in VSCode:**
    -Open Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
    -Go to File -> Open Folder, and select the folder where you cloned the repository.
3. **Install Live Server Extension:**
    -In VSCode, go to the Extensions tab (on the left sidebar).
    -Search for Live Server and install it.
4. **Run the Site:**
    -Once the Live Server extension is installed, open the index.html file.
    -Right-click on the file and select Open with Live Server.
    -The website should open automatically in your default browser at http://127.0.0.1:5500/.

**This portfolio uses these basic HTML tags for structuring the website:**

This portfolio uses basic HTML tags to structure the website in a simple and organized way. Headings like h1, h2, and h3 are used for titles and subtitles, while the p tag is for paragraphs of text. The table tag is used to show information in a clear format, with tr and td tags for rows and cells inside the table. Images are displayed using the img tag, and the a tag creates clickable links to projects on GitHub and social media. The form, input, and textarea tags allow users to send messages through the contact form. The section tag is used to divide the website into different parts, like Home, Projects, Skills, and Contact. The footer tag holds information at the bottom of the page, such as copyright details and links to social media. Other tags like nbsp, strong, br, and align are used to format the content, adding spaces, bold text, line breaks, and text positioning. The bgcolor attribute sets the pageâ€™s background color, while width and height are used to control the size of images and table cells.
